# TFL Analysis using Spark

This project employs Apache Spark 3.3.2 (Spark 2023a) to test two hypotheses related to bike rentals in London in 2014. The hypotheses examine the duration of bike rides in different seasons and the relationship between bike rentals and traffic volume.

## Project Overview

- **Hypotheses:**
  - The first hypothesis explores whether people ride longer in autumn than in spring.
  - The second hypothesis investigates the relationship between bike rentals and traffic volume.

- **Datasets Used:**
  - Transport for London (TFL) cycle hire usage stats for 2014 (London 2015).
  - Road traffic statistics relating to London from the Department for Transport (DFT) (Transport 2015).

## Project Highlights

- Utilised Apache Spark 3.3.2 for data analysis and hypothesis testing.
- Tested two hypotheses related to bike rentals in London in 2014.
- Found statistically significant differences in bike ride durations between spring and autumn.
- Explored the relationship between bike rentals and traffic volume.
- Correlation analysis revealed little correlation between bike rentals and traffic volume.

## Conclusion

The analysis of bike rentals in London provided valuable insights. While there is evidence of longer bike ride durations in spring compared to autumn, the relationship between bike rentals and traffic volume remains inconclusive. Further research, incorporating geographical data, may offer a more accurate representation of traffic patterns and their impact on bike rentals.
